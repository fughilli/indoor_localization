# Swarm wire format (swarm.v1)

Every structure that crosses a link between swarm nodes, or between a node and the host, or
sits in the staging partition is a protobuf message in `swarm/proto/swarm_wire.proto`
(see [pbview.md](pbview.md) for the policy). One schema, three consumers:

| Consumer | Where | How |
|---|---|---|
| C++ (radio, loader) | `apps/common/radio.cpp`, `apps/loader` | pbview zero-copy views of `LinkFrame`; encoding with `pbv::Writer` |
| Rust (swarm_net) | `swarm/net` | micropb structs; Summary / Manifest / Fw* / MeshPacket / settings |
| Python (host tools) | `swarm/tools/swarm_wire.py`, `swarm_ctl.py` | protoc-generated `swarm_wire_pb2` |

## What changed from the packed structs

The old frames were fixed-offset little-endian structs (an 8-byte link header, a 9-byte mesh
header, `count u16 | (key u16, value u32)*` layers, a 108-byte manifest). Protobuf costs bytes
(tags, varint widths), so the budgets below are the contract. They are worst cases (every
varint at maximum width) and are asserted by tests.

- **Signed and tagged things are envelopes** `{body, tag}`: the HMAC (settings) or ECDSA
  signature (manifest) covers the exact `body` bytes as transmitted; nobody re-encodes before
  verifying or re-serving. Protobuf's lack of a canonical encoding therefore does not matter.
- **The manifest has its own link frame type** (`FRAME_TYPE_FW_MANIFEST`) instead of riding a
  mesh packet: a signed manifest is up to 114 bytes, which cannot also carry a mesh header.
- **The magic byte is gone.** `LinkFrame.ver = 1` plus a strict parse (`Parse` validates framing,
  wire types and UTF-8) rejects foreign and legacy frames.
- **Compatibility.** There is none with the packed protocol: every board (loader and main) is
  reflashed once over USB (`swarm_ctl.py flash`); the loader cannot be updated over the air.

## Budgets (bytes)

The DW3000 standard PHR allows 127 bytes, 2 of them FCS: a frame is at most **125**.

| Frame | Link header (worst case) | Body | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| POLL (to a peer; a beacon has no dst) | ver 2, type 2, src 4, dst 4, seq 3, slot 2 = 17 | advert 2 + 64, summary 2 + 26 | 111 |
| RESPONSE | 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 15 | advert 2 + 64 | 81 |
| REPORT | 15 | two fixed32: 10 | 25 |
| RESULT | 15 | sint32: 4 | 19 |
| MESH (broadcast) | 2 + 2 + 4 + payload tag/len 2 = 10 | MeshPacket <= 115 (header <= 24, payload <= **88**) | <= 125 |
| FW_DATA (broadcast) | 10 | FwData: 6 + 3 + 2 + (2 + 96) = 109 | 119 |
| FW_REQUEST (unicast) | 14 | FwRequest <= 18 | 32 |
| FW_MANIFEST (broadcast) | 10 | Manifest <= 114 | 124 |

## Constants derived from the budgets

| Constant | Old | New | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| mesh `MAX_PAYLOAD` | 108 | 88 | 125 - 10 link - 24 mesh header, 3 bytes slack |
| settings `FRAG_DATA` | 100 | 72 | `BundleFragment` overhead 14 inside 88; a bundle is at most ~975 bytes, so <= 14 fragments |
| override `CMD_MAX_ENTRIES` | 16 | 7 | 10 bytes per `Setting` plus the envelope inside 88 |
| report entries per part | 16 | 6 | 12 bytes per entry plus a 16-byte head inside 88 |
| `CHUNK` / `PAGE_SIZE` | 96 / 4096 | unchanged | |
| `MAX_KEYS` | 96 | unchanged | |
| bundle read buffer (`kMaxBlob`) / `TAG_MSG_MAX` | 1024 / 640 | 1024 / 1024 | a full bundle is ~975 bytes |

Rust asserts these at compile time against the encoded worst case (`swarm/net`), C++ in
`apps/common/link_test.cc`.

## Staging partition

Sector 0 of the staging partition holds `varint(length) || Manifest` (a length-delimited
message; erased flash reads as "no manifest"). The image starts at offset 4096.

## Not covered (still JSON)

The USB serial protocol between a node and its host (newline-delimited JSON, with binary
payloads as hex) is not a link between embedded systems and is unchanged; its binary payloads
now carry the protobuf messages above.
